\chapter{Resolution and Numerical Integration of Differential Algebraic Equations}

\label{ch:overview}

As well pointed out in \cite{petzold1982differential} both from theoretical
point of view that the numerical, DAEs are much more challenging than ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). Some DAEs can be solved using numerical methods
for stiff systems but others cannot and they are very sensitive to the step
size and this may cause large errors in the solution and numerical instability.
For DAEs coming from constrained mechanical systems a fairly general form is the following, 
%%%
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:generalformequationofmotion}
	\begin{align}
		\bm{M}(\bm{q})\ddot{\bm{q}} 
		-\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal}\lambda 
		&= \bm{n}(\bm{q},\dot{\bm{q}},t),\\
		\bm{\phi}(\bm{q},t) &= 0
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%%%
where the term $\bm{n}(\bm{q},\dot{\bm{q}},t)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ collects all 
the contributions coming from Coriolis and centrifugal effects, 
conservative and non-conservative forces, e.g., it may be definite as follows,
%%%
\begin{equation*}
	\bm{n}(\bm{q},\dot{\bm{q}},t) = \bm{\tau}-\bm{C}(\bm{q},\dot{\bm{q}})\dot{\bm{q}}-\bm{g}(\bm{q}).
\end{equation*}
%%%
It is well known that the equations of motion for a mechanical
system are a system of second order (possibly) non-linear differential equations.
However for clarity and for sake of generality it is useful to consider a
\emph{first order representation}.
For this purpose let us define $\bm{p}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$
as \emph{generalized velocities}, i.e.,
%%%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:firstordersubstitution}
	\bm{p} := \dot{\bm{q}}.
\end{equation}
%%%
Thus substituting \cref{eq:firstordersubstitution} into
\cref{eq:generalformequationofmotion} results, 
%%%
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:generalequationofmotionfirstorder}
	\begin{align}
		\dot{\bm{q}} &= \bm{p}, \\
		\bm{M}(\bm{q})\dot{\bm{p}}
		-\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal}\bm{\lambda}
		&= \bm{n}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t),\\
		\bm{\phi}(\bm{q},t) &= 0.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%%%
Notice that the vector $(\bm{q};\bm{p})\in\mathbb{R}^{2n}$
represents the \emph{state} of a mechanical system, namely the pair
\emph{generalized position} and \emph{generalized velocity}.

Now a good question is how to solve the problem in
\cref{eq:generalequationofmotionfirstorder},
the issue is certainly how to determine the value for the
Lagrange multiplier $\bm{\lambda}$.
One possible approach is to transform the problem into a
system of pure differential equations.
In order to do so we need to differentiate the constraint
$\bm{\phi}(\bm{q},t)$, this yields to
%%%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:diffconstraint}
	\frac{\diff\bm{\phi}}{\diff t} =
	\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{p}+\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial t}=0.
\end{equation}
%%%
Notice that when constraint does not depend on time \cref{eq:diffconstraint}
expresses the intuitive idea that generalized velocity $\bm{p}$ must be orthogonal
to constraint's gradient.
This provide also the opportunity to notice that constraint
$\bm{\phi}(\bm{q},t)$ imposes relationships also at the velocity
and acceleration level, e.g., \cref{eq:diffconstraint} restricts
the set of feasible velocities. The constraints can we can obtain
differentiating the constraint are somehow called \emph{hidden constraints}.
Finally notice that \cref{eq:diffconstraint} is still algebraic in
the $\bm{p}$ coordinate, thus in order to obtain a differential
relationship let us differentiate again,
%%%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ddiffconstraint}
	\frac{\diff^2\bm{\phi}(\bm{q},t)}{\diff t^2}
	= \frac{\diff}{\diff t}\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{p}
	+\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{\dot{p}}+\frac{\partial^2\bm{\phi}}{\partial t^2}=0.
\end{equation}
%%%
Notice that now \cref{eq:ddiffconstraint} does not impose any algebraic
constraint on the state of the mechanical system $(\bm{q};\bm{p})$.
Thus substituting the constraint $\bm{\phi}(\bm{q},t) = 0$
with the one in \cref{eq:ddiffconstraint} results the following modified problem,
%%%
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:generalequationofmotionfirstorderdiffconstraint}
	\begin{align}
		\dot{\bm{q}} &= \bm{p}, \\
		\bm{M}(\bm{q})\dot{\bm{p}}
		-\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal}\bm{\lambda}
		&= \bm{n}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t),\\
		-\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{\dot{p}}
		&= \frac{\diff}{\diff t}\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{p}
		+\frac{\partial^2\bm{\phi}}{\partial t^2} := \bm{m}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t).
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%%%
Here to simplify the notation we introduced the symbol $\bm{m}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t)\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$.
However even if the idea of differentiating the constraint seem good,
the problem in \cref{eq:mechanicalDAE} and the one in
\cref{eq:generalequationofmotionfirstorderdiffconstraint} are
\emph{not equivalent}.
This difference produces the so called \emph{drift effect}
that will be investigated in next section.
At the moment let us ignore this complication and
continue on the taken path. System of equations in
\cref{eq:generalequationofmotionfirstorderdiffconstraint}
can be also written in compact matrix notation as,
%%%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:numericalscheme}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\bm{I} 	&	0		&	0 \\
		0	& 	\bm{M}(\bm{q}) 	&	-\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal} \\
		0 	& -\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}} & 0\\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot{\bm{q}}\\
		\dot{\bm{p}}\\
		\bm{\lambda}
	\end{bmatrix}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\bm{p} \\
		\bm{n}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t) \\
		\bm{m}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t)
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
%%%
Now it's easy to see that if the matrix on the left hand
side of \cref{eq:numericalscheme} is invertible,
then we can express the system in explicit form and use
this representation to perform numerical simulations. 		
It easy to see that the matrix is invertible if and only if the sub-block,
%%%
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\bm{M}(\bm{q}) & -\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal} \\
		-\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}} & 0
	\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbb{R}^{(n+m)\times(n+m)},
\end{equation*}
%%%
is non-singular (full rank). In order to prove this we can use
the rank additivity formula which states the following, 
%%%
\begin{equation*}
 	\rank{\begin{bmatrix}
 		\bm{M}(\bm{q}) & -\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal} \\
 		-\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}} & 0
 	\end{bmatrix}} 
 	= \rank{\bm{M}(\bm{q})} + 
	\rank{\left( \frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{M}(\bm{q})^{-1}
	\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal}\right)}.
\end{equation*}
%%%
First recall that matrix $\bm{M}(\bm{q})$ is positive definite
(so also non-singular), then $\forall\bm{q}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}, \rank{\bm{M}(\bm{q})} = n$.
Thus what is missing is the condition
%%%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:compression}
	\rank{\left( \frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}
	\bm{M}(\bm{q})^{-1}\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal}\right)} = m,
\end{equation}
%%%
which is not generally true. Fortunately assuming the constraints
(locally) linearly independent each other, i.e., $\forall\bm{q}\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\forall t$
%%%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:independentcondition}
	\rank{\left(\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\right)} = m, 
\end{equation}
%%%
\cref{eq:compression} holds, matrix in \cref{eq:numericalscheme}
is invertible and the overall system can be expressed in \emph{explicit first order form} as follows,
%%%
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\dot{\bm{q}}\\
		\dot{\bm{p}}\\
		\bm{\lambda}
	\end{bmatrix}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\bm{I} 	&	0		&	0 \\
		0	& 	\bm{M}(\bm{q}) 	&	-\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal} \\
		0 	& -\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}} & 0\\
	\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\bm{p} \\
		\bm{n}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t) \\
		\bm{m}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t)
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
%%%
An explicit expression for the inverse matrix above can be obtained
through tedious calculations and it is shown in \cref{subsec:matrixinverse}.
However regardless the specific expression of the solution we want stress
a very important point; differentiating the constraint we were able to
find an explicit expression for the Lagrange multipliers.
For this purpose we differentiated twice and we obtained \cref{eq:ddiffconstraint}.
Then isolating the acceleration $\bm{\dot{p}}$ from \cref{eq:generalequationofmotionfirstorder} results,
%%%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:genvelo}
	\dot{\bm{p}} = \bm{M}(\bm{q})
	\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal}\bm{\lambda}
	+\bm{M}(\bm{q})^{-1}\bm{n}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t) = 0.	
\end{equation}
%%%
Thus substituting \cref{eq:genvelo} into \cref{eq:ddiffconstraint} results,
%%%
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\diff}{\diff t}\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{p}
	+ \frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{M}(\bm{q})^{-1}
	\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal}\bm{\lambda}
	+\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{M}(\bm{q})^{-1}
	\bm{n}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t)+\frac{\partial^{2}\bm{\phi}}{\partial t^{2}}.
\end{equation}
%%%
Here we recognize the nonsingular matrix in \cref{eq:compression},
therefore an explicit expression for the Lagrange multipliers is the following,
%%%
\begin{equation*}
	\bm{\lambda} = 
	-\left(\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{M}(\bm{q})^{-1}
	\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}^{\intercal}\right)^{-1}
	\left(\frac{\diff}{\diff t}\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{p}
	+\frac{\partial\bm{\phi}}{\partial\bm{q}}\bm{M}(\bm{q})^{-1}\bm{n}(\bm{q},\bm{p},t)
	+\frac{\partial^{2}\bm{\phi}}{\partial t^{2}}\right). 
\end{equation*}
%%%
Technically Mechanical systems subject to holonomic constraints are systems
of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of \emph{differential index} 3.
The differential index is one plus the number of differentiations of
the constraint that are needed in order to be able to eliminate the
Lagrange multipliers. Otherwise, equivalently, the number of times
that we need to differentiate the constraint in order to obtain a
differential equation also for the Lagrange multiplier.
